# PsychicGame

## Description: 

The psychic randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the psychic chose. 

The application will diplay:
*Wins: (number of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
*Losses: (number of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
*Guesses Left: (number of guesses left. This will update)
*Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, the Wins counter increases and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and restarts the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

It's a simple application utilizing HTML and Javascript
